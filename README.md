we will create an organization for our group and have everyone review a persons code before pushing their code to the dev branch. Merging will be done by 2 other people that didnt work on the code, and have tested to make sure the code looks and works well. Designated approval for main will be assigned to 2 people at the beggining of the first meeting.
